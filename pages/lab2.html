					<h4>Cartographic Design - Draft Thematic Map</h4>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/lab-2.webp">

					<p>This is my submission for the thematic map, the topic I wanted to look at was the use of water on Marlborough farms and the general water deficit</p>
                    <p>The annual water deficit is based on a water balance model using monthly estimates of mean daily temperature, mean daily solar radiation, and mean rainfall, this layer is used as an indicator of soil dryness.</p>
                    <p>I was curious to see where water is used on farms in a region of the country that I knew were heavily irrigated, it followed the trend I was expecting. Another interesting pattern I noticed was that almost all of the irrigated land are vineyards.</p>

                    <h4>Cartographic Design - Final Thematic Map</h4>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/Lab2-final.jpg">

					<p>The feedback I received on my layout was directed towards the alignment of legend and title items which I have amended. The other point that was brought to my attention was that it was difficult to see if the land below the irrigated areas was consistent with the rest of them map, so I changed the parcels to have an outline rather than a solid fill. 
                    <p>There was a remark made about a blurb being attached to explain the map information, which I hadn't included on padlet but I have here, however I felt that adding a blurb to the map would have cluttered the map.</p>

                    <h4>Classmate Feedback</h4>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/lab-2.2.webp">

                    <p>Hi Nick, I really like the colours that you've chosen for the features. It looks clean and tidy with the basemap you've chosen. The visual hierarchy is well balanced on the page and it does a good job of bringing your focus to the area you've chosen. The design overall is consistent and cohesive.</p>
                    <p> I only have minor critiques with some of the labels and legend, they are a little hard to read due to a lack of contrast from the white outline and thin font. I think either increasing the size of the font or picking one that was a little thicker it might make it easier to see, otherwise, nice map!</p>
