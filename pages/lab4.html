					<h4>Vector Analysis of Manawatu Gorge Alternatives</h4>
					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/LayoutLandscape2.jpg">
					<p>Lab 4 involved vector analysis of 4 possible routes through the Manawatu Gorge, the map pictured
						displays our chosen options. Each route will be assessed for its impact on the land cover and
						the impact of the slope along each path. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="article-2">

					<h4>Landcover Analysis</h4>
					<p>I took the data from ArcGIS and created some graphs in Python. Excel is rather restrictive with
						the charts and I found this the best way to display the data. As expected in the land cover
						analysis, the longer routes have a greater amount of land cover impacted. All routes cut through
						a significant amount of farmland, routes 1 and 3 cut through the most amount of indigenous
						forest. Route 3 and 4 have the most impact on built up areas. </p>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/landcover_area_by_route.png">

					<p>The slope analysis showed that route 1 would involve the most amount of work, this is expected as
						it is the longest and as seen on the map the path cuts through the mountain range. Route 3 looks
						to be the best route based purely on slope impact analysis.</p>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/slope_area_by_route.png">
					<p>The ranking system I developed is simple yet effective. Each route's land cover area is ranked on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 indicating the lowest area and 4 representing the highest. If a route has no value for a particular land cover type, it is given a score of 0. The same scoring system is applied for slope. The scores for each land cover type and slope are then tallied in a table, giving each route an overall total score.</p>

					<p>This approach allows us to identify the route that has the least impact on the land. No preference is given to specific types of land use. Initially, I considered assigning different weights to certain categories, but I decided against it, as this analysis is intended for a quick overview rather than an in-depth assessment of environmental or human settlement impacts.</p>
					
					<p>Using this ranking system seen below, Route 2 was deemed the best option, as it had the lowest impact across the board, despite being longer and having a greater slope than Route 3.</p>
					
					<p>I attempted to visualize this data using Python, although I'm not sure a heatmap was the most appropriate display. A heatmap may be unnecessary, as it's often used to represent more complex relationships and gradients. Since the data is primarily categorical ranks (1-4, and 0), simpler visualizations like bar charts or ranked lists could convey the information more directly.</p>
					
					<p>Nevertheless, the heatmap provides a quick visual impression of which routes are more intensive in terms of land cover use across multiple types, which could justify its use depending on the audience and presentation goals.</p>
					
					<p>In conclusion, this ranking system provides a practical overview of the impact of different routes, especially when a quick assessment is required. If more detailed environmental impact studies are needed, integrating weights based on ecological or social value would be an effective enhancement.</p>
