					<h4>Coastline Paradox and Map Scale</h4>
					<p>The coastline paradox and map scale are closely related. The idea of the coastline paradox says
						the length of a coastline isn't easily measurable as it seems to grow infinitely as you measure
						it in smaller units. This happens because coastlines have a fractal nature, meaning they show
						similar patterns at different scales.</p>
					<p>Map scale compares a map's distance to actual earth distance, a larger scale map shows a smaller
						area in more detail, while a smaller scale map covers a bigger area with less detail.</p>
					<p>Smaller scale maps (covering bigger areas) when related to coastlines, look smoother and
						straighter, making the distance seem shorter when measured. As you follow more straight lines
						you would end up underestimating coastline length.</p>
					<p>As you zoom in to a large scale more details such as bays, inlets and peninsulas become apparent.
						Measuring the coastline to now include those details requires following the curve rather than
						straight line, making it seem longer.</p>
					<p>The coastline paradox shows how map scale affects the perceived length of a coastline. The
						measured length doesn't show the actual length as it depends on the scale and the detail level.

					<h4>The Robinson Projection</h4>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/robinson-projection.png">

					<p>In the 1960s, Arthur H. Robinson, a geography professor, developed a map projection that became
						more popular than the Mercator projection for world maps. It aimed to address the distortions of
						the Mercator projection, offering a more realistic representation.</p>

					<p>The Robinson projection replaced the Mercator projection as the preferred choice for world maps
						by major publishers like Rand McNally and National Geographic.</p>

					<p>It maintains a balance between area and shape distortions, with less severe distortions than the
						Mercator projection. The Robinson projection uses a pseudo-cylindrical shape, with the Equator
						serving as the standard parallel. Unlike the Mercator projection, which has evenly spaced lines
						of latitude and longitude across the map, only the central meridian (longitude) in the Robinson
						projection is straight; all other lines of longitude curve, with increasing curvature farther
						from the central meridian.</p>
