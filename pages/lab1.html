					<h4>Coastline Paradox and Map Scale</h4>
					<p>The coastline paradox and map scale are closely connected</p>

					<h4>Coastline Paradox:</h4>
					<p>This idea says the length of a coastline isn't straightforward and seems to grow infinitely as
						you measure it in smaller units. This happens because coastlines have a fractal nature, meaning
						they show similar patterns at different scales.</p>

					<h4>Map Scale:</h4>
					<p>This is about how a map's distance compares to actual Earth distance. A larger scale map shows a
						smaller area in more detail, while a smaller scale map covers a bigger area with less detail.
					</p>

					<h4>How They Work Relate:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Smaller scale maps (covering bigger areas): With less detail, coastlines
							look smoother and straighter, making them seem shorter when measured. It's like using a
							ruler on a world map - you'll mostly follow straight lines, underestimating the actual
							length.</li>
						<li>Larger scale maps (covering smaller areas): When you zoom in, you see more
							details like bays and peninsulas. Measuring the coastline now means following these curves,
							making it seem longer. Think of tracing a bay's coastline on a close-up map - you'll capture
							all its twists and turns, making it seem longer.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>So, the coastline paradox shows how map scale affects the perceived length of a coastline. The
						measured length doesn't show the actual length but depends on the scale and detail level.

					<h4>The Robinson Projection</h4>

					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/robinson-projection.png"> 
					
					<p>In the 1960s, Arthur H. Robinson, a geography professor, developed a map projection that became more popular than the Mercator projection for world maps. It aimed to address the distortions of the Mercator projection, offering a more realistic representation.</p>

					<p>The Robinson projection replaced the Mercator projection as the preferred choice for world maps by major publishers like Rand McNally and National Geographic.</p>
				
					<p>It maintains a balance between area and shape distortions, with less severe distortions than the Mercator projection. The Robinson projection uses a pseudo-cylindrical shape, with the Equator serving as the standard parallel. Unlike the Mercator projection, which has evenly spaced lines of latitude and longitude across the map, only the central meridian (longitude) in the Robinson projection is straight; all other lines of longitude curve, with increasing curvature farther from the central meridian.</p>
