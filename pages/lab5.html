					<h1>Agroforestry Suitability Analysis</h1>
					<h4>1. Define the Problem</h4>
					<p>
						The project aims to identify suitable land for different
						agroforestry crops in Fiji's Sigatoka Valley, focusing exclusively
						on soil-related and environmental factors. This clear definition
						helps target the study's efforts directly towards the factors that
						influence crop viability, ensuring that the analysis is relevant
						and manageable.
					</p>

					<h4>2. Structure the Problem</h4>
					<p>
						To structure the problem, we identified the necessary data layers
						based on the cultivation criteria for the crops. These criteria were
						compiled into a reference table, outlining the GIS datasets
						needed. This step is crucial as it maps out the variables and data
						structures required for the spatial analysis, ensuring that all
						essential factors are considered.
					</p>

					<h4>3. Acquire and Prepare Data</h4>
					<p>
						The data was sourced from various established databases and
						resources. The preparation
						involved several key processes:
					</p>

				<div class="article-2">

					<h4>Converting Vector Data to Raster</h4>
					<p>
						This was essential for handling soil data, which originally
						existed in vector format. The conversion facilitates easier
						manipulation and analysis in GIS.
					</p>

					<h4>Generating Slope Data from Elevation</h4>
					<p>
						Using digital elevation models, we converted elevation data to
						slope data, crucial for evaluating terrain suitability.
					</p>

					<h4>Creating Climatic Rasters via IDW Interpolation</h4>
					<p>
						We interpolated point data for rainfall and temperature to create
						continuous raster surfaces, providing a detailed environmental
						overview.
					</p>

					<p>
						These preparation steps were fundamental to ensuring that the GIS
						data was ready for detailed spatial analysis, setting the stage
						for our next analysis phase which was to combine the three maps to find areas which all crops
						could be grown.

					<h3>Spatial Analysis of Crop Suitability</h3>
					<img class="article-img" src="/assets/lab5_3maps.jpg">
					<h1></h1>
				</div>
					<p>The spatial analysis provided clear insights into the distribution and suitability of land for
						the specified crops:</p>
						<h4>Vesi (Intsia bijuga):</h4>
						<p>This crop showed the least suitability, with only 7,651
								hectares being appropriate for its cultivation. This indicates limited growth
							potential for Vesi possibly due to it's restrictive requirements for good growth and the regions varied environmental conditions.</p>
					
						<h4>Cutnut (Barringtonia edulis):</h4>
						<p>Demonstrated a higher level of suitability, with 116,112
								hectares deemed suitable. This suggests that the region's environmental
							conditions are favorable for cutnut cultivation, potentially making it a key agricultural
							asset.</p>
						<h4>Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis):</h4>
						<p>Had a substantial proportion of suitable land, with 55,580
								hectares. This indicates that breadfruit can thrive over a wide area, likely due to it's tolerance for growing at higher elevations</p>
					</div>
					<div class="summary">
						<h2>Key Observation:</h2>
						<p>A noteworthy observation from the analysis is that the total area suitable for all three
							crops corresponds precisely to the area suitable for Vesi (Intsia bijuga), suggesting that the specific
							conditions required for Vesi cultivation are the limiting factor for multi-crop cultivation
							in this region.</p>
							<p>
								Below is a map outlining the areas which are suitable for all three crops.
