	<p>At Powersurge I am currently working on a project to showcase variations in lighting designs and interiors, the renders come into play when clients want to get a rough idea of how each piece they are purchasing will look in their respective spaces. The quick turnaround allows Powersurge to showcase the lighting and iterate on existing designs. <br><br>

	To save on production time and costs I have also been tasked with rendering possible designs for future lighting, the lights use the same basic pieces which are then moved rotated or extended in various ways. Once each design is looked over we then narrow it down to a select few and take the designs further from there.

	Role: 3D Modelling, texturing, rendering.
